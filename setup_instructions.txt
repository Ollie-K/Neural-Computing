Instructions to run on a City University Lab machine:
1. Extract all files from this zip file
2. Open a conda shell & navigate to the Submission folder
3. Run the commmand: 
	$ conda env create --file ok_environment.yaml
4. Run the command: 
	$ conda activate ok_nc_env
	NB - if a popup is seeing requiring admin details to allow python.exe to make changes to computer, you may select 'no'. The installation of the environment should still complete without issue.
5. To perform testing only, run the command:
	$ jupyter notebook "OKeers NC Testing.ipynb" 
6. Run all cells in the notebook (n.b. the final cell, 57, initiates 1000 prediction runs for both models for timing purposes. This takes a long time to complete; feel free to omit.
7. To remove the environment, run the commands:
	$ conda deactivate
	$ conda env remove --name ok_nc_env
